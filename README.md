# ExploringTheSpaceOfShortPrograms

The only file necessary to understand this repository is ExploringSpaceOfShortPrograms.ipynb. Open using the command `jupyter notebook`, and make sure to use python3.

In the jupyter file I analyze the data created by the other files in the repository. The scheme file zot.scm houses an interpreter for the zot programming language, which is based on the universal iota combinator. search.sh houses the shell script that generates the zot code, and passes the output to export.txt.
